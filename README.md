Adds an upgrade planner that can be used to upgrade tiles. Redux fork with additional features and bug fixes.

Hold the upgrade planner in your hand to configure it. Hold shift to clear tile ghosts.

## Mod compatibility

The tile upgrade planner should be compatible with any tile from other mods. If the following mods are detected, the default config is changed accordingly.

- [Electric Tiles](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/electric-tiles): The default config is completely replaced with an upgrade path to replace each vanilla tile with the corresponding electric tile.

If you want to see default config support for other mods, feel free to open a discussion thread on the mod portal or a GitHub issue.
